*"Left for Japan yet ?"*

There are only two possibilities when a message reaches me: either it's my guy spamming about how he needs communism, or someone who just lent me money for lunch that I didn't intend to pay back. But this time, neither. That person who pulled me out of the monotony of life back then, was finally finding her way back to my corner of it.

The message that once again, lit up the screen, did exactly what it had done two years ago.
\
\
\
*"...No"*, said I.

*"Then see ya !"*
\
\
\
*"Here, my schedule, pick some !"*

Okay Miss Celebrity, I gotta

Got a message saying she had arrived while I was waiting for a two-minute long red light was even worse than 

Every morning I have to fight for a parking slot at company, now it's happening again.

Took me like decades to get back to the ground. My legs were shaking, I had walked too much today. I had to use all escalators this building has just because this bloody five-story mall doesn't have a motherfvcking elevator. This is bad, I better figure a way to escape this labyrinth because her "Five minutes are up!" message is slapping into my face. Gosh, please lead me to this rendezvous!



And from afar, 

I was... stunned, like literally. There weren't many people around, but I'm pretty sure you guys would recognize a celebrity in a crowd, even if she was in disguise. Her presence caught me off guard, a sudden clearing in the woods after years of wandering. I held my step, my heart stalled as I wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me. We were only a table away, but then, she looked up. Our eyes locked, and in that split second, the hazy memories sharpened into focus. The uncertainty vanished.
\
\
\
*"Found ya."*

*"Yet someone said to be here at 8."*
\
\
\
Those smiling eyes that brought joy, yet she mimicked what I myself had said an hour earlier, sarcastically. Spare me please, years of bug-fixing had perhaps eroded my last remaining sense of time. I 

Forgive me for haven't dined at such places since our last meet.
\
\
\
*"Your workplace, ain't there girls ?"*
\
\
\
Oh yeah, here we go again. If this girl didn't start this then I'm sitting with a wrong person. Yes, that inquiry about my status, did eventually arise. 

If we were badmouthing someone, he or she would know about it because that person is literally sitting just three steps away from you in a 50 square meters room.
\
\
\
*"You won't."*

*"You won't."*

*"H...huh ?"*

*"It's a binding contract, means you won't see me in the next three years."*

*"No problem. I'll meet you there."*
\
\
\
Bitch said as my goddamn career is just like her summer trip. So yeah she has the right to say that.

\
\
\ 
Being seduced by a smile, so that’s how it was. 

Tethered me back to the present.
\
\
\

There's a guy, he goes to the office at day and get to a postgraduate class at night, even weekends, yet his progress at work is always     . Great one, isn't he ? comparison is the thief of joy, I admitted that, 

But, there were moments, moments when the conversation fell into silence, a quiet gap where I realized we now lived in different countries, our only common ground was the distant memory of secondary school. In such time, I had the chance to truly look at her. She was the same, yet entirely different. Her hair had grown long, falling with a certain grace I didn't recognize, and she looked healthier, prettier, in a way that time usually doesn't allow. I found myself wearing a faint, involuntary smile, looking at her was like finding a quiet corner in a loud world – a quiet, peaceful vista that finally stilled the chaotic buzzing in my head.


Her best female friend finally got a boy friend, size gap, quet app, t tu choi, lo quet trung giao vien


The kind of girl who knows her smile will melt anyone's heart. For a second, I was reliving a moment two years ago.
the feeling of longing for something
If this isn't nice, what is ?

There's only two things that could possibly come up whenever we mentioned an old friend, either that one is married, or no longer in this world.     Oh come on, she was the one who brought it to the table first.


Bring me to the rendezvous.

\
\
*"You dress like this at work ?"*

*"No, to meet you."*
\
\
\
Be in that hip-hop style then I better pack my stuff and get back to my country, at least that's what my technical leader said. But hey, I think that has been ingrained in the blood of any guy for a long time. Three pants for a week, two are enough but in case of a rainy day. And shirts ? Boy I got a collection of them from events, centers, companies,... which would suffice my entire career. Are they doing charity now ?

I hate it whenever my intuition is right, but this time, it was a

If Faker has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth.
