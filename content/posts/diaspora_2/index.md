*"Left for Japan yet ?"*
​\
\
\
\
There are only two possibilities when a message reaches me: either it's my guy spamming about how he needs communism, or someone who just lent me money for lunch that I didn't intend to pay back. But this time, neither. That person who pulled me out of the monotony of life back then, was finally finding her way back to my corner of it.

The message that once again, lit up the screen, did exactly what it had done two years ago.
\
\
\
*"...No"*, said I.
\
*"Then see ya !"*
\
\
\

\
\
\
*"Here, my schedule. Pick some !"*
\
\
\
Okay Miss Celebrity, 
\

A two-minute red light has never felt longer. Getting her arrival text while I was stuck here really got on my nerves. The moment it bled from red to green, I was gone – weaving through the city like a comet after I asked her for another five minutes.

Finally made it to the place after almost finding eternal sleep under a car. Great, she must be somewhere on the second floor, coincidentally, the parking lot is also on the second floor... underground. Every morning I have to fight for a parking spot at the office, and here I was, doing it all over again.

Took me like decades to get back to the ground. My legs were shaking, I’d done enough walking for a lifetime today. I had to use every escalator this building has just because this bloody five-story mall doesn't have a motherfvcking elevator. This was bad, I better figure a way to escape this labyrinth because her "Five minutes are up !" message was slapping me in the face. Gosh, please lead me to the rendezvous !
\
\
\
\
\
And from afar, her silhouette carved through the crowd.
\
\
\
\
\
I was... stunned, like literally. There weren't many people around, but I'm pretty sure you guys could recognize a celebrity among people even though she was in disguise. Her presence caught me off guard, a sudden clearing in the woods after years of wandering. I held my step, my heart stalled as I wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me. We were only a table away, but then, she looked up. Our eyes locked, and in that split second, the hazy memories sharpened into focus. The uncertainty vanished.
\
\
\
*"Found ya."*
\
*"Yet someone said to be here at 8."*
\
\
\
Those smiling eyes that brought joy, yet she mimicked what I myself had said an hour earlier, sarcastically. Spare me please, years of bug-fixing had perhaps eroded my last remaining sense of time.

Forgive me for haven't dined at such places since our last meet.

If we were badmouthing someone, he or she would know about it because that person is literally sitting just three steps away from you in a 50 square meters room.
\
\
\
\
\
*"I can make it the next year, then we can hang out again."*
\
*"You won't."*
\
*"H...huh ?"*
\
*"It's a binding contract, means you won't see me in the next three years."*, I hesitated.
\
*"No problem. I'll meet you there."*
\
\
\
\
\
Bitch said as my goddamn career is just another stop on her summer trip. But for someone who just traveled 8,000 miles to get here, not to mention days of her wandering around the capital, then yeah I guess she has the right to say that.

Told her a bit about that place in Japan. It’s right on the edge of the capital, yet somehow, there are still rice paddies everywhere. Like strange crossroads of the rural and the modern, every  house here is topped with sleek solar panels, as if two different centuries are trying to live in the same space. Good news is, the cost of living here is quite cheap. Bad news ? If I can’t afford a bicycle like my colleague, I’ll be trekking to work, on foot, in zero-degree weather. He told me that if I arrived right at the start of spring, the cherry blossoms would be breathtaking. Not like him who arrived in the dead of winter, greeted by nothing but skeleton-dry trees. To make matters worse, the place sits right against the coast. Honestly, I’m not sure what’s going to kill me first: the crushing loneliness, or a tsunami.
\
\
\
*"How's your postgrad ?"*
\
*"Will finish in May."*
\
\
\
I ended up questioning about some aspect of her life. And yeah, I guess she really went for the degree after our last meet since 2024. Time flies, doesn't it. Before long, "Miss or Mrs", if she were asked, I guess it'll be "Master".

Speaking of which, I realized that cant cook
\
\
\ 
Being seduced by a smile, so that’s how it was. 

Tethered me back to the present.
\
\
\


But, there were moments, moments when the conversation fell into silence, a quiet gap where I realized we now lived in different countries, our only common ground was the distant memory from secondary school. In such time, I had the chance to truly look at her. She was the same, yet entirely different. Her hair had grown long, falling with a certain grace I didn't recognize, and she looked healthier, prettier, in a way that time usually doesn't allow. I found myself wearing a faint, unconscious smile, looking at her was like finding a quiet corner in a loud world – a quiet, peaceful vista that finally stilled the chaotic buzzing in my head.
\
\
\
\
*"My bestie, she finally got a boyfriend !"*
\
*"Oh ? And how on earth did that happen ?"*
\
*"Dating app !"*
\
\
\
Gotta pretend surprised since my communist friend had already told me this like weeks ago. Remember her bestie from our secondary school ? Well, that girl finally broke her twenty-five-year curse of never having a first love. Her standards for men has long been known for being sky-high. Shocked – was our only appropriate expression. "Why don't you give it a shot ?" – a hint of insistence in her voice. Shm, I gave a shrugging smile, before I have a chance to get to see a casual love, I'd probably end up matching one of my male highschool teachers.
\
\
\
*“Your workplace,..”* she started, tilting her head. *“Aren’t there any girls ?”*
\
\
\
Oh yeah, here we go again. If this girl hadn't started this then I'd have been sitting with the wrong person. Yes, that inevitable inquiry about my status, did eventually arise, which really made me ponder quite a bit lately. Did she really have a genuine curiosity why a guy like me hasn't been with someone for half a decade, or she just honestly wished for everyone she knew to be happy ? For the kind of girl whose smile that could melt anyone's heart, I hoped the latter was true.

the feeling of longing for something
If this isn't nice, what is ?

There's only two things that could possibly come up whenever we mentioned an old friend, either that one is married, or no longer in this world.     Oh come on, she was the one who brought it to the table first !



\
\
\
*"You dress like this at work ?"*
\
*"No, to meet you."*
\
\
\
Dressing in that hip-hop style then I better pack my stuff and get back to my country, at least that's what my technical leader said. But hey, I think that has been ingrained in the blood of any guy for a long time. Three pairs of pants for a week, two are enough but in case of a rainy day. And shirts ? Boy I got a collection of them from events, centers, companies,... which would suffice for my entire career. Are they doing charity now ?

I hate it whenever my intuition is right, but this time, it was a

If Faker has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth.
