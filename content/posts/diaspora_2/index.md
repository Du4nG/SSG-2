*"Left for Japan yet ?"*
​\
\
\
\
There are only two possibilities when a message reaches me: either it's my guy spamming about how he needs communism, or someone who just lent me money for lunch that I didn't intend to pay back. But this time, neither. That person who flicked me in the forehead back then, was finally finding her way back to my corner of it.
\
\
\
*"...No"*, said I.
\
*"Then see ya !"*
\
\
\
Guess I'm about to lose my three-month Wordle streak, again. Every time I head out for a night that mixes up my routine, I hardly can remember to play it, although it bears in my brain, before I even have my dinner. I also went for Strands recently, so, dang it! But anyhow, the feeling is more fresh than bitter. How long has it been since a message turned me into a little child ?
\
\
\
*"Here, my schedule. Pick some !"*
\
\
\
Okay Miss Celebrity, gotta make a reserve before her decadent outing here when she landed made her forget that I even existed.

A two-minute red light has never felt longer. Getting her arrival text while I was stuck here really got on my nerves. The moment it bled from red to green, I was gone – weaving through the city like a comet after I asked her for another five minutes.

Finally made it to the place after almost finding eternal sleep under a car. Great, she must be somewhere on the second floor, coincidentally, the parking lot is also on the second floor... underground. Every morning I have to fight for a parking spot at the office, and here I was, doing it all over again.

Took me like decades to get back to the ground. My legs were shaking, I’d done enough walking for a lifetime today. I had to use every escalator this building has just because this bloody five-story mall doesn't have a motherfvcking elevator. This was bad, I better figure a way to escape this labyrinth because her "Five minutes are up !" message was slapping me in the face. Gosh, please lead me to the rendezvous !
\
\
\
And from afar, a silhouette carved through the crowd.
\
\
\
I was... stunned, like literally. There weren't many people around, but I'm pretty sure you guys could recognize a celebrity among people even though she was in disguise. Her presence caught me off guard, a sudden clearing in the woods after years of wandering. I held my step, my heart stalled as I wasn't sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me. We were only a table away, but then, she looked up. Our eyes locked, and in that split second, the hazy memories sharpened into focus. The uncertainty vanished.
\
\
\
*"Found ya."*
\
*"Yet someone said to be here at 8."*
\
\
\
Those smiling eyes that brought joy, yet she mimicked what I myself had said an hour earlier, sarcastically. Spare me please, years of bug-fixing had perhaps eroded my last remaining sense of time.

I went around the menu, while she just sat there watching me with this quiet, loving gaze. Okonomi, wakame, tonkatsu, misoshiru... hours of anime watching had somehow made me know exactly what the heck these things were. It felt... weirdly nostalgic, like being taken out to eat by my mom after I got good grades at the end of the year, when I was an elementary school student, so calm, and safe.
\
\
\
*"You forgot the salad !"*
\
\
\
Yep, that's also what any mom would say.
\
\
\
Uh... Are we eating with our hands ? She glanced me again then looked towards a box nearby, where the chopsticks were hidden. Forgive me for haven't dined at such places since our last meet. Call me vanilla, but yeah I tend to stick with 



Told her about some of the gossip that I had happened to know recently, about some crazy ass guys on the internet, about how autistic I gradually became since I and my team now had had to move to a separate, isolated room, just because a so-called "technology privacy" hardware were shipped in from oversea. If we were badmouthing someone, he or she would know about it because that person is literally sitting just three steps away from you in a 50 square meters room.

. Okay... didn't know that people dine in such a scientific way, even in some specific order. 
Dang an nong, khong duoc an lanh
\
\
\
*"Til I make it the next year, then we can hang out again."*
\
*"You won't."*
\
*"H...huh ?"*
\
*"It's a binding contract, means you won't see me in the next three years."*, I hesitated.
\
*"No problem. I'll meet you there."*
\
\
\
Bitch said as my goddamn career is just another stop on her summer trip. But for someone who just traveled 8,000 miles to get here, not to mention days of her wandering around the capital, then yeah I guess she has the right to say that.

Told her a bit about that place in Ibaraki. It’s right on the edge of the capital, yet somehow, there are still rice paddies everywhere. Like strange crossroads of the rural and the modern, every house here is topped with sleek solar panels, as if two different centuries are trying to live in the same space. The good news is, the cost of living here is quite cheap, at least that's what I was hoping for. The bad news ? If I can’t afford a bicycle like my colleague, I’ll be trekking to work, on foot, in zero-degree weather. He told me that if I can make it before the start of spring, the cherry blossoms would be breathtaking. Not like him who arrived in the dead of winter, greeted by nothing but skeleton-dry trees. To make matters worse, the place sits right against the coast. Honestly, I’m not sure what’s going to kill me first: the crushing loneliness that would drive me insane day after day, or a tsunami.
\
\
\
*"How's your postgrad ?"*
\
*"Will finish in May."*
\
\
\
I ended up questioning about some aspect of her life. And yeah, I guess she really went for the degree since the last time we saw each other. Time flies, doesn't it ? Before long, "Miss or Mrs", if she were asked, I guess it'll be "Master".

But did you . 
*"Homework, cooking, you tell me."*
\
\
\
Speaking of which, if a cooking competition were held, I'd be the first to be disqualified, my knowledge of the kitchen is next to zero. Which, isn’t good at all, especially since my colleague claimed I’d likely never find a favorite place to eat out around here. Why ? Because there are none !
\
\
\ 

Tethered me back to the present.
\
\
\


But, there were moments, moments when the conversation fell into silence, a quiet gap where I realized we now lived in different countries, our only common ground was the distant memory from secondary school. In such time, I had the chance to truly look at her. She was the same, yet entirely different. Her hair had grown long, falling with a certain grace I didn't recognize, and she looked healthier, prettier, in a way that time usually doesn't allow. I found myself wearing a faint, unconscious smile, looking at her was like finding a quiet corner in a loud world – a quiet, peaceful vista that finally stilled the chaotic buzzing in my head.
\
\
\
*"My bestie, she finally got a boyfriend !"*
\
*"Oh ? And how on earth did that even happen ?"*
\
*"Dating app !"*
\
\
\
Gotta pretend surprised since my communist friend had already told me this like weeks ago. Remember her bestie from our secondary school ? Well, that girl finally broke her twenty-five-year curse of never having a first love. Her standards for men has long been known for being sky-high. Shocked – was our only appropriate expression. *"Why don't you give it a shot ?"* – a hint of insistence in her voice. Shm, I gave a shrugging smile, before I have a chance to get to see a casual love, I'd probably end up matching one of my male highschool teachers.
\
\
\
*“Your workplace...”* she started, tilting her head. *"Ain’t there any girls ?”*
\
\
\
Oh yeah, here we go again. If this girl hadn't started this then I'd have been sitting with the wrong person this whole evening. Yes, that inevitable inquiry about my status, did eventually arise, which really made me ponder quite a bit lately. Did she really have a genuine curiosity why a guy like me hasn't been with someone for half a decade, or she just honestly wished for everyone she knew to be happy ? For the kind of girl whose smile could melt anyone's heart, I hoped the latter was true.

If this isn't nice, what is ?

\
\
*"You know Gwen ?"*
\
\
\
Yeah, we’d never really talked, but yeah I do know her. Most people from our secondary and high school days are connected on social media in some loose way, though the only thing we used to share was a hallway. Perhaps we don't know much about each other, but we all at least once brushed past one another on the campus, shared some stories between mutual friends. Gwen was one of them, a tangible link that completed a discrete chain back in the days when we were just adolescents. At least, she was, until a few weeks ago, when she was no longer in this world. Car accident, that's what I was told. How impermanent such a human life was. But, didn't I just have such experience while rushing to get here ? I did think about it quite a bit lately, whether I should continue to stick with the hype of my 60mph daily commute, or slow down before I wipe everything I ever tried to acquire into nothingness, before I forget how she pulled me out of uncertainty, before Murphy comes for me.

I told her there were two things that could possibly come up whenever we mentioned an old friend, either that one was getting married, or no longer existed in this world. She giggled, then instantly glared at me menacingly. Oh come on, she was the one who brought it to the table first !
\
\
\
*"You dress like this at work ?"*
\
*"No, to meet you."*
\
\
\
Dressing in that hip-hop style then I better pack my stuff and get back to my country, at least that's what my technical leader said. But hey, I think that has been ingrained in the blood of any guy for a long time. Three pairs of pants for a week, two are enough but in case of a rainy day. And shirts ? Boy I got a collection of them from events, centers, companies,... which would suffice for my entire career. Are they doing charity now ?

I hate it whenever my intuition is right, but this time, it was a 
*"Go touch some grass, badminton perhaps, maybe you will get someone."*
\
\
\
I never asked why she said that, maybe some guys drenched in sweat just ignited a spark of excitement in her, after having some matches at her friend's place whose house is a goddamn badminton court rental service. But hell no, sport was never my thing. 

Being seduced by a smile, so that’s how it was.
