The same song, the same volume, the same dull ceiling staring back at me. I got up, got dressed, went to work. The fluorescent lights hummed. The keyboard clicked. The same faces nodded at me, exchanging words that no longer hold meaning. Went home. Ate. Slept.
\
\
\
Then woke up again.
\
\
\
Nothing changed. Nothing shifted. Days blurred into each other, time looping around like a snake swallowing its own tail. I started questioning if I ever made a choice, or... if choices were ever mine to make. Til one night, when the air felt heavier, and the shadows stretched just a little too long. A voice, neither friend nor foe, spoke from the corner of my dimly lit room.
\
\
\
*"You’ve noticed, haven’t you ?"*
\
\
\
Am I... stuck ?

A loop. A cycle.

A maze with no walls. 

A prison with no bars.

I had been here before, over and over again. The memories flooded back. 

The walking.

The searching. 

The endless wander.

A figure stepped forward, shrouded in something darker than the night itself. Not human, not quite a monster. A daemon ? A genie ? Whatever it was, it watched me with something between pity and amusement. Two choices, either breaks the cycle or stay here forever, convincing myself that tomorrow will be different.

But, you and I both know, tomorrow is just yesterday, dressed in a new lie. 

The footprints on the floor that matched my own. I didn’t remember how I got here. Because I never left. The daemon smiled, and in its shifting form, I finally recognized the face.
\
\
\
**Mine.**
\
\
\
Go look in the mirror, what's in it ?

\

Nothing, even a silhouette. What are we staring at ? A restrained robot, a hollow vessel, a soulless corpse, a fractured mannequin, or perhaps, you.


I made a habit of writing, yet I didn't have plenty of drafts, not because I was some kind of a disciplined person, but much like how I only find solace in befriending words when the daily mayhem randomly kicks in, which, doesn’t usually happen.

frame of mind

I get easy to stuck in the loop of thought of uneccessary stuffs, like you were walking around 
I had a Korean colleague, the name – Jaemin. He's young, seems like a hectic person. One time,
told me that we were not in a university, there's no time for the dissect things.
It's like when someone tell you to find a way to drive a truck, instead of reading the driver handbook, you tried to comprehend the principle of the combustion engine.

The toilet in my office. Month after month, within four walls smaller than three square meters, every morning, I rooted there for nearly an hour, eating my sandwich, leaning my head against the wall and couldn't cry my eyes out. But I wasn't at home, I had work to do, I had to get a grip on myself. Jaemin was right, this isn't a university, nor a kindergarten so I can shed my tears.

\
\
\
What's the catch here ?
\
\
\

\
\
People.
\
\
\
When the time comes, you will have to leave, every single one of them. Yes, I'm being selfish, and making a fuss, my words sound like I was the protagonist of some ridiculous unscripted movie.

Live long enough and you will start to realize people's vices. Words, beliefs, even their misconceptions that have lingered in your brain long enough, you’ve mistaken theirs for your own.

Take it or leave it, there is not much time. My cognition was thousands of miles apart, my body was falling into the abyss, 
What kind of deep magic is this ? 
Do not cite the deep magic to me, I was there, the day it was written.
Knowing that when I open this door, will be the shed of no return.

You don't need more time, you just need to decide. Yes, then do it. I will do it, thousands of time telling myself I wouldn't not let this chance slip away. asdfasdf Even the slightest attempt, at any price, has to be made.

There are different kinds of loop. Say you were 
Everyday feels like a fairy tale, like a pixie steps in and walks you through the cycle of pleasure. If 
congrats! But if it's not, how long would that last ? People were strong enough to crawl their ways out of hell, are you strong enough to leave heaven behind ?

\
\
The next time you find yourself stuck in a loop, at all costs, find the spot. Like a glitched spot in an arcade game, when Vanellope drove in reverse then took a hidden underground route, observing every single one of the opponents, items, shortcuts, even deprecated characters. One step backward and the spot shall appear, either you are sober enough to seek for it, or remain chained to the delusional effort, til the concept of time rots away. People have themselves someone who keeps their mind from straying, even if that person is no longer with them. Others carry an inseparable thing in their bag, like Cobb's totem. Mine ? A knitted amulet.

万能薬

You were there, flesh and bone
even my neighbors see me by luck
agony
sedate
figment
convo
nothingness
starred
to amount to
vestige of hope
what's the catch here ?
here's the catch
with great power comes great electricity bill
you don't see that everyday
uh , Control-Alt-Delete, I guess ?
trippin'
drive insane
in the nick of time
If this isn't nice, what is ?
Let's teach fish how to swim
remedy
nemesis
give me a break
again, just, come to your senses
hear me out
do-over
long for something
that's the neat part, you don't
to infinity and beyond

Extroverts always want the introverts to talk more, yet no one is telling the extroverts to shut the fvck up. 
Anh đón gió đêm, làn gió đó thổi qua em. Như vậy có tính chúng ta ôm nhau không

"The perfect kind of weakness
The sickly kind of sweetness

You’re my enemy and my light
Darkest night, The curse of you and I
Maybe if we could turn back time
We’ll survive, the curse of you and I"

柔弱
最後の砦



steins;gate ep 21

あの ね 最近 怖い 夢 ばっかり 見る ん だ
夢 の 中 で ね いつも まゆ し ぃ は ひどい 目 に 遭う の
ピストル で パン て 撃た れ たり
車 の 事故 に 巻き込ま れ たり 電車 に ひか れ たり …
まるで 本当の こと み たい で
す っ ごく 怖く て 痛く て
悲しく て …
誰 か 助け て って 一生懸命 声 出す ん だ けど
出せ なく て …
どうして そんな 夢 見る の か な ？
で ね その 夢 の 最後 に は
いつも オカリン が 助け に 来 て くれる の
まゆ し ぃ は ｢ オカリン ありがとう ｣ って 言う ん だ けど
その 声 も オカリン に は 聞こえ なく って
まゆ し ぃ の こと 抱きしめて とって も 悲し そう な 顔 を し て
絶対 泣か ない ん だ けど 一生懸命 我慢 し てる の が 分かる の
だから まゆ し ぃ も
｢ ごめん ね ｣ って 言う ん だ けど
声 は やっぱり 届か なく て
目 が 覚める の
